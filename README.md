## Description
Dan Motors is open for business! I will be building out an application, Dan Motors, that enbles user view what on offer. 

## Setup
Run this command to get the backend started:

```console
$ json-server --watch db.json
```

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:

[http://localhost:3000/vehicles](http://localhost:3000/vehicles)

Then, open the `index.html` file on your browser to run the application.

Write my code in the `js/index.js` file. The base URL for my API will be
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Core Deliverables
As a user, I can;
1. See the vehicle details including the model and year
2. Search for vehicles details based on the input parameters and append them on DOM
3. On clicking the more info button, the vehicle details are shown
